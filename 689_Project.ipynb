This document-level sentiment is then compared against each fine-grained, aspect-specific sentiment labeled by the human annotator to calculate an overall accuracy score. The final output includes a classification report that highlights the limitations of using sentence-level analysis for aspect-based tasks, particularly its inability to distinguish conflicting sentiments within a single review."
